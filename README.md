# The Game of Life

## Description  
Implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** in Python. This is a zero-player game where an initial state evolves based on predefined rules.

## Rules  
1. A live cell with **fewer than 2** live neighbors dies (underpopulation).  
2. A live cell with **2 or 3** live neighbors survives.  
3. A live cell with **more than 3** live neighbors dies (overpopulation).  
4. A dead cell with **exactly 3** live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction).
